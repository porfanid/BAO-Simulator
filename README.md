## üöÄ Overview

The **Baryon Acoustic Oscillations Simulator** is an interactive web application that visualizes one of cosmology's most fascinating phenomena: the ripples in the distribution of matter originating from sound waves in the early universe. This simulator allows users to explore the fundamental processes that shaped our universe's large-scale structure.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Interactive Visualization**: Watch in real-time as sound waves propagate through the primordial plasma and shape the distribution of matter
- **Adjustable Parameters**: Customize the simulation with controls for:
  - Number of particles
  - Simulation speed
  - Initial matter density
- **Real-time Metrics**: Track the simulation's progress with:
  - Elapsed time in millions of years
  - Universe scale factor
- **Educational Content**: Learn about BAO through integrated explanations and visual demonstrations

## üî¨ The Science Behind BAO

Baryon Acoustic Oscillations are the imprint of sound waves that propagated through the hot plasma of the early universe. These waves created a characteristic pattern in the distribution of matter that we can still observe today in galaxy surveys.

This simulation demonstrates:
1. How initial density fluctuations created pressure waves
2. How these waves propagated through the primordial plasma
3. How the universe's expansion "froze" these waves into the matter distribution
4. How this created the characteristic BAO scale (~150 Mpc) observed in galaxy surveys

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

The simulator uses pure JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3 to create a physics-based particle system that models:
- Particle interactions with sound wave fronts
- Cosmological expansion effects
- Density fluctuation evolution

The simulation runs entirely in the browser with no external dependencies, making it accessible for educational use across different platforms.

## üß† Educational Applications

This simulator serves as an excellent educational tool for:
- University-level cosmology courses
- Public outreach and science communication
- Self-directed learning about cosmic evolution

## üìã Usage Instructions

1. **Start the Simulation**: Click the "Start Simulation" button to begin
2. **Adjust Parameters**: Use the sliders to modify:
   - Number of particles (100-2000)
   - Simulation speed (1-10)
   - Initial density (1-10)
3. **Pause/Resume**: Click the same button to pause or resume the simulation
4. **Reset**: Click "Reset" to start over with new initial conditions
